    How often do cyclical topologies emerge?
        Not very often in the more famous algorithms apparently. Might be possible to ignore this case.

    What space should I be evolving, expression tree space or cyclical topologies.
        Expression tree space seems to still be the best bet

    Can all topologies be represented as expression trees? If this is true, I could run crossover as an array representation and mutation as randomly selecting a node and effectively be exploring the full space of topologies.
        It seems that all non-cyclical topologies have an equivalent experssion tree

    Can we try to map some famous topologies (perhaps Chowning instruments) into expression trees?
        Possible second experiment. Going to begin with recreating classic FM algorithm from input FM sound file/carrier frequency/modulator frequency

    Filter design? How to calculate max filter gain from poles/zeroes?

    Talk about fitness function more/spectral leakage/STFT/overlapping transform. What do you think about emphasizing peaks and valley and weighting the middle less so? Penalizing undershooting or overshooting based on peaks/valleys?
