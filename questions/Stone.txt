What should my experimental results be?

My goal is not to:
    Produce an exact representation of a given target sound. Method is too stochastic
    Produce a recognizable mimic of a target sound

Idea for experiment:
    Five sound files: Trumpet, Bassoon, Violin, Piano, Snare drum
    Test evolution params:
        pop size 1000 with greedy over-selection
        100 generations
        30 experiments
    Variables:
        Types of nodes available
        Fitness function (compare Garcia/Horner/Donahue)
        Mutation rates
        Other GP params
    How to compare results:
        Find most convincing replicas across all experiment runs of each controlled variable
        Play the results for musicans and non-musicians and see if they can identify the target instrument
        Analyze human timbral comparisons to find best method for each instrument
        OPTIMISTIC: play fake and real see if they can determine which is which
        Police line style, play all results against targets and see if nonmusicians can classify.
        turk style

    one experiment that shows the system works
    make one thing that is as convincing as possible that this works
