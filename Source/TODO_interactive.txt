Interactive:
    10 networks, 4 or 5 faders, one keyboard
    Button to interactively suboptimize constants
    Ability to edit network
    PITCHBEND
    Introduce Novelty button replaces current network with new full()
    Buttons to step backwards through evolution
    button to run random evolution for a while towards a target with best suboptimization method
    novelty search of new spectrum elements/spectral peak ratios
    Add max note length as a slider to GUI in order to make TimeNode potentially useful
    primative/options menu:
        available primitives (two adjacent lists) (oscils with center frequency at 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, etc)
        maxNoteLength
        maxNetworkHeight
	
	v0.2:
		more primitives
            may have to implement wave table reading synthesis with interpolation
            generator nodes would then just generate buffer based on mutatable params at setRenderInfo time or construction depending on what is necessary
            could try Audacity stuff for now
            FINISH and TEST SPLINE
        options page:
            num networks
            maxnotelen
            maxnetworkheight
            initialnetworkmaxheight
            primitive selector
        random button
        reset button
        string view of network with sliders for mutatable params and update button
		check how fitness probabilities are working
		display name of synth if loaded or saved
        vst plugin save current generation

Names:
	synthsearch
	exploration synthesis
		
Web:
	Save button posts network to mySQL db
	make personal website utilizing django in some way for practice
	maybe make database entries for synthesizers in order to set up a platform for future use
	figure out how to host stuff on UTCS
	host the web server from NN lab. also go there to get form
