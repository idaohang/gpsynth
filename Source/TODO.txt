Main.cpp:
    Add command line for MIDI stuff
    --help
    check argument ranges

GPExperiment.cpp:
    Pass time-varying variables to evaluate()
    fill and use sampleTimes for efficiency

GPNetwork.cpp:
    Fix constructor to parse a network from a string
    
GPSynth.cpp:
    Fill in selectFromEvaluated() skeleton code including greedy over
    Implement other types of reproduction
    do TODOs
    make a map from network ID to GPNetwork*
    remove fitness containers
    change evaluated and upForEvaluation to sets for out of order evaluation/multiply fitness assignments
    fix printGenerationSummary logic stuff

Node subclasses:
    ConditionalNode
    ValueNode split to ConstantNode and VariableNode
    fill in virtual methods

Other things:
    make new fitnessFunctionType that spawns an interactive plugin and two buttons for "like/not"

Tomorrow:
    make fitness stuff use the map
    make new fitness function type for interactive
    implement some cool node subclasses
    if time, MIDI omg gunna be so cool!
