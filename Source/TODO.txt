Main.cpp:
    Add command line for MIDI stuff
    --help
    check argument ranges

GPExperiment.cpp:
    Pass time-varying variables to evaluate()
    fill and use sampleTimes for efficiency

GPNetwork.cpp:
    Add new syntax parsing to string parser
    
GPSynth.cpp:
    Fill in selectFromEvaluated() skeleton code including greedy over
    Implement other types of reproduction
    do TODOs
    maybe remove rawFitness container

Node subclasses:
    DelayNode
    FilterNode
    ADSRNode
    ConditionalNode
    add evaluateBlock(*t, *v, n samples) to all subclasses :(
    maybe extend parity possibilities to make for better time-varying filters

Other things:
    make new fitnessFunctionType that spawns an interactive plugin and two buttons for "like/not"
    crossover at shallower nodes have different probabilities?

Interactive:
    10 networks, 4 or 5 faders, one keyboard
    Button to interactively suboptimize constants
    Introduce Novelty button
    Buttons to step backwards through evolution
    button to run random evolution for a while

Tomorrow:
    Node subclass stuff :/

Thoughts and Ideas:
    novelty search of new spectrum elements
