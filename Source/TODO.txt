Main.cpp:
    Add command line for MIDI stuff
    --help
    check argument ranges

GPExperiment.cpp:
    Pass time-varying variables to evaluate()
    fill and use sampleTimes for efficiency
    change evaluateIndividual to accept (float*) for better malloc symantics

GPNetwork.cpp:
    Fix constructor to parse a network from a string
    
GPSynth.cpp:
    Fill in selectFromEvaluated() skeleton code including greedy over
    Implement other types of reproduction
    do TODOs
    maybe remove rawFitness container

Node subclasses:
    ConditionalNode
    fill in virtual methods for all

Other things:
    make new fitnessFunctionType that spawns an interactive plugin and two buttons for "like/not"
    crossover at shallower nodes have different probabilities?

Tomorrow:
    make new fitness function type for interactive
    implement some cool node subclasses
    if time, MIDI omg gunna be so cool!

Thoughts and Ideas:
    Punish silence-producing networks maximally
    Read Horner et al!
    novelty search of new spectrum elements
    OscilNode's left overrides modulates oscillator
