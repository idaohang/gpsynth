Main.cpp:
    Add command line for MIDI stuff
    --help
    check argument ranges

GPExperiment.cpp:
    Pass time-varying variables to evaluate()
    fill and use sampleTimes for efficiency

GPNetwork.cpp:
    Fix constructor to parse a network from a string
    
GPSynth.cpp:
    Fill in selectFromEvaluated() skeleton code including greedy over
    Implement other types of reproduction
    do TODOs
    make a map from network ID to GPNetwork*
    remove fitness containers
    change evaluated and upForEvaluation to sets for out of order evaluation/multiply fitness assignments
    fix printGenerationSummary logic stuff

Node subclasses:
    ConditionalNode
    ValueNode split to ConstantNode and VariableNode
    fill in virtual methods

Other things:
    make new fitnessFunctionType that spawns an interactive plugin and two buttons for "like/not"

Tomorrow:
    Fix container nonsense in most generic way possible for GPSynth. Allow for out of order evaluations, block evaluations, etc. etc.
    make new fitness function type for interactive
    implement some cool node subclasses
    if time, MIDI!
