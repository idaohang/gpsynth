Main.cpp:
    Add command line for Envelope stuff somehow
    Add command line for all GPParams
    --help
    check argument ranges
      renderBlockSize > frames in file?
      fftSize > frames in file?

GPExperiment.cpp:
    Pass time-varying variables to evaluate()
    fill and use sampleTimes for efficiency
    do TODOs

GPNetwork.cpp:
    Add new syntax parsing to string parser once node subclasses finalized
    
GPSynth.cpp:
    Fill in selectFromEvaluated() skeleton code including greedy over
    Maybe implement other types of reproduction
    do TODOs
    maybe remove rawFitness container

Node subclasses:
    DelayNode
    ConditionalNode
    consider changing evaluate to return floats as well as all GPFUNCTIONS... (float) double efficiency?

Interactive:
    10 networks, 4 or 5 faders, one keyboard
    Button to interactively suboptimize constants
    Ability to edit network test and add things like PITCHBEND
    Introduce Novelty button
    Buttons to step backwards through evolution
    button to run random evolution for a while
    novelty search of new spectrum elements/spectral peak ratios

Ideas:
    use GPHelper to map a range for OscilNode's index of modulation
    crossover at shallower nodes have different probabilities? (exponentially distribute crossover point selection depth)
    finish implementing DifferenceEquationNode. turns out my difference equation idea from the start might have been better somehow. need to find a way to guarantee min/max though
    maybe add "prepare to play" abstract to GP node to replace if (fn == 0)
    framework to change constants over time that depend on pop convergence

Thoughts:

TODO long run:
    calculate min/max stuff with lo/hi filter node if you have resonance, alter bandwidth/quality calculation
    print ranges/save networks in text file/just save ID's in waves
    update README
    implement a structure for fading more params by the convergence of the population. numeric mutation, numeric mutation amounts, mutation, etc.
    figure out how to start without being in initialise method (new thread)
    confirm removed DC offset from fitness function
    fleschter munsion? :/

TODO FOR NEXT EXPERIMENT (by Wednesday):
    comparison to average for fitness function should be in log dB scale and need to remap height/average stuff to actually work
    check how many partials lie above average for trumpet sound
        maybe change fitness function to measure partials relative to maximum instead of absolute magnitude

    test one at a time save data on condor
    increase num partials to (unsigned) (nyquist/fundamental)?
    check if numericalMutation is working right or not
        maybe relate numericalMutation to the fitness of the individual. this way particular numbers can be altered more in accordance to deviations from the mean
    try another sample
    get filters/noise back in the mixture
    perhaps fitness function needs to consider different domains independently by a sum:
        envelope comparison
        spectral content
        noise shaping
        phase
    CONDOR JUST DO IT! check memory usage
    change GPRandom to compile on condor
