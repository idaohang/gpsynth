	Koza from GP97: The finding of numeric constants is a skeleton in the GP closet... [and an] area of research that requires more investigation."
	
3 Numeric Mutation:
	Numeric mutation replaces all of the numeric constants with new ones in the individuals to which it is applied
	New numeric constants are chosen uniformly at random within a specific selection range
	The selection range for each constant is specified as the old value of that constant plus or minus a temperature factor
	The temperature factor is determined by multiplying the raw score of the best individual of the current generation by a temperature variance constant, 0.02 in this paper
	Selection range is larger when best individual is poor.
4 Experimental Evaluation:
	Numeric mutation applied to 40 randomly selected individuals of the 200 with the best fitness from a population of size 1081
	Each selected indivdual is replaced with a copy wherein each numeric constant has been mutated
	The fitness function is reevaluated for each of the new individuals so that the fitness-ranking of the population corresponds to the altered population
	Used elitist graduated overselection strategy to select individuals from the population for reproduction and crossover, as described in Evett and Fernandez 1997
