Genetic Programming Application in Virtual Reality:
	Discussing genetic programming in a virtual environment
	
	1. Introduction
		1.1 Background:
			Search for shapes and sounds
		1.3 Sound and GA's:
			The generation of musical sound is usually seperated into timbre generation and composition
			Horner describes a technique for deriving FM parameters to approximate a desired sound using genetic algorithms
		
		This paper describes the "CAVE" which is this thing at UIC in the 90's that had a bunch of crazy shit. Not really relevant.
